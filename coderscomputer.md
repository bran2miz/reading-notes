## Different Classifications of Text Editors

In the world of coding, text editing tools enable the ability to use code language, which allows one to essentially *"create a website"*. However, according to this article, it can be extremely nerve-wrecking to decide which editing tools to choose from. There is a mulititude of text editors out there, so choosing one really depends on what best suits each individual. This article described **three** different types of text editors and their different variates. This information could provide hopeful coders to narrow down which tool could most benefit them. 

### 1. The already installed Software

> that a computer user should have one software installed **already**! 

**Text Edit** is the most primitive computer software out there. There are many variates to notepad:

1. On linux computers, the text editor could go by the name of "Gedit".
2. On Windows computers, the text editor could go by the software called "Notepad".

Although easily accessed for the majority of computer users, Text Edit **does not** possess alot of important and extraneous features. Features that are not included are as follows:

1. *Code completion* - text that appears in the editor to "complete" a code to prevent an editor in making errors to their text.
2. *Syntax highlighting* - Different parts of the text that are separated by various colors, allowing the coder to revise errors.
3. Themes- Ability in the text editor to change the background and color of the text to easy rectify mistakes, or add new coding.
