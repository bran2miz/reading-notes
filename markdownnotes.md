# Markdown Notes

When I first learned coding in high school, the coding format was not only long but seemingly difficult. For example using the symbols, *<* and *>*, it would look something like this:

> i.e. <html>
>      <body></body>
>          </html>

However, learning markdown has has shown me the wonders on how technology has truly changed over the course of a decade. In the most simplest of terms, markdown is the newest language to create one's own webpage. Used on the plaform known as Github, **writing codes that once took _several hours_** (in my case several days), takse only a few minutes with **markdown**. 

With a simple asteric sign * one can make text **Bold** and *italic*. You can even **do _both_** using an underscore. Utilizing the "~" symbol twice, you can ~~cross out text!~~ Writing new headings would be such a pain, but now

### One can make a heading just with the *#* key.

There are a number of excited and new aspects of markdown that you can experience for yourself that will ~~excited~~ **Blow Your Mind!!** For example, creating tables is such a breeze! Using the symbol, *-* and |,

> * Your Own (|) Table 
> * -------- (|) ----- (adding "-" to separate the first heading text from the below cells)
> * Add your own text in the first box here |(pressing shift + \ to separate each cell)

Your Own | Table
-------- | -----
Add your own text in the first box here |(pressing shift + \ to separate each cell)
