# Reading Notes for CodeFellows

This is my reading notes repo to track all of my reading notes.

## About Me

My name is Brandon Mizutani. I am a current student at CodeFellows. I love to travel, explore new restaurants, and shop.

### My take on growth mindset

For myself, I am very much in a fixed mindest. I am always second-guessing myself and believe that I cannot change. However, by taking this first step in joining CodeFellows, I feel like I am beginning to develop a growth mindset. 

To me growth mindset is the desire to want to make changes in your life, believing in yourself, and drowning out the sound that tells you that you can't.

- Remind yourself that you are able to succeed.
- Be willing and open to make mistakes, and get back up if you fail.
- Even the darkest of times, have a positive mental attitude to difficult challenges that may come.
